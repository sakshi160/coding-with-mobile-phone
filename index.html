    According to some people, coding on mobile phones is impossible. But we have proved it wrong. Anyone can Code on mobile. Though, the environment of android and windows is different. But they have similarities too. With the help of some apps we can create great projects by coding on mobile itself. All you need is to just get started.</p>
    <p>Hi, I am sakshi Tripathi from greater noida chapter of udayan care. I am in 12th class. I live in haldoni, Uttar Pradesh. I started my coding journey through  Udayan Coding Bootcamp program. It was a 4 month long bootcamp where we learned a lot of amazing things and created a lot of interesting projects.

 <p>We used some apps for coding on mobile phone. Names with link and description are mentioned below:</p>

 <!-- Coding journey -->
 <p >When I started the coding, I was unable to understand some things. And I did not have laptop so I thought I cannot do coding but Nancy di and  Pradipta sir taught me how to do code using a mobile phone. Due to Preboards, I was not regular but I catch it up with the help of Aayushi Di.  Nancy di and Pradipta sir helped a lot. We also asked them anything and anytime if we couldn't understand that in class time. They also took extra classes, so that all of us can come at same pace.<p>

 <p>Coding is very interesting. It will help you to increase your problem solving skills and creativity. Do you know? Apps, Websites, Voice Assistant, etc. are made up by coding. If you have an idea, you want build some project to solve a particular problem or even if you want to play around with code then just dive into this enjoyable journey. And at least you should give it a try. If I can do it, then why can't you!
